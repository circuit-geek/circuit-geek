# 👋 Hi there! I'm Gaurav Prasanna

I'm a passionate and curious learner with a deep interest in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and especially the rapidly evolving field of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I enjoy exploring the intersection of theory and application — from understanding model architectures to building real-world AI systems.

## 🧠 Research & Technical Interests

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Architecture, fine-tuning, prompting, and function calling
- **Transformer-based Models**: Attention mechanisms
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Semantic understanding, embeddings, generative text
- **Mathematics of Deep Learning**: Optimization, result explainability

---

## 🌱 What I'm Actively Exploring

- Design and deployment of **LLM-powered applications**
- Prompt engineering and multi-agent orchestration
- Emerging paradigms like **tool-augmented LLMs**, **retrieval-augmented generation**, and **structured function calling**
- Keeping pace with cutting-edge research and model developments in the LLM space

---

## 🤝 I'm Open To

- Collaborations on LLM/NLP-based projects or research
- Contributing to open-source tools around language models
- Discussions on trends in AI research, tools, and systems

---

## 💬 Ask Me About

- Architectures of LLMs and how they work under the hood
- Getting started with building applications using LLMs
- Transformer theory or NLP concepts you're curious about
- Anything related to ML/DL — happy to share what I know!
